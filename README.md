# card-count
Practice card counting

My goal of this project is to put my current JavaScript skills to the test, as well as HTML/CSS, by creating a resource that teaches how to count cards. The concept of card counting has always intrigued me. I've never spent time studying it, and my plan to do so has always been on the backburner. Using this project, I plan to learn the concept, while also continuing my coding practice, and perhaps colaborating with likeminded individuals to further progression for all involved.
