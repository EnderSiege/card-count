Practice card counting

My goal of this project is to put my current JavaScript skills to the test, as well as HTML/CSS, by creating a resource that teaches how to count cards using the Hi-Lo strategy. The concept of card counting has always intrigued me. I've never spent time studying it, and my plan to do so has always been on the backburner. Using this project, I plan to learn the concept, while also continuing my coding practice, and perhaps colaborating with likeminded individuals to further progression for all involved.

I understand the way that I am working on this project is most certainly not the best way. I'm simply using concepts as I learn them. I plan to return to this project as I continue learning.

Using the following resource as a guide:
